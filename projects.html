        <h2>Haughey's Clothing</h2>
        <p>Haugheys Clothing vision is to create affordable, styley and fashionable streetwear that enables people to represent where they come from or places
they love in New Zealand. Haugheys Clothing was inspired by the street i was raised in and the vast amount of people i was raised with in Central Auckland.
The dream of creating where we no longer have to struggle was vital and giving those an opportunity to wear clothing to represent where they come from 
thats styley, comfortable and fashionable will not only help our people look super fly but also enhances their confidence to connect with their roots and 
stomping grounds. Haugheys Clothing creates clothing for people from all walks of life and all ages. Haugheys Clothing is the only New Zealand online
streetwear website that creates clothing to help people find their purposes and connection to their identity with clothing.
